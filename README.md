## Hi there 👋

I'm Lucas Spilhaus and welcome to my GitHub page.  
Here you'll find various projects from my time at Dev Academy and a few of my own personal ones.

Here are a couple small projects I've completed or worked on through Dev Academy:  
https://github.com/lucas-spilhaus/todo-full-stack  
https://github.com/lucas-spilhaus/dreamfest

And here is my final group project:  
https://github.com/Karengo-2025/Messaging-App/branches

This was out final project to end bootcamp with. Our group of five ended up making a messaging app similar to Discord or Messanger. This was our first long group project, spaning 2+ weeks, much longer than the 4-5 days we had been getting. Because we had the extra time we decided to use Web Sockets to allow for live messaging which was a challenge as we hadn't used it before, but it turned out really well. My role was primarily back-end work, such as database calls.
